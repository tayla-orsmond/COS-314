# COS 314 Assignment 1

## Tayla Orsmond - u21467456

## Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or higher
- Preferably JDK 17 as this is the version I used to compile

## How to run

1. Double click on the run.bat file to execute it. This will open up the terminal so you can see the console output.
2. The application should now start running.
3. Once it is finished, the results will be available in the "**Solutions**" folder.
    - These results are categorized by algorithm and dataset.
    - There is a solution file for every PI, as well as an overall summary of the dataset and a Summary_report file.
    - The Summary_report file contains a overall summary for each dataset and algorithm (ass seen in the report). This file is printed to the console at the end of the program.

## Issues

If the .bat file doesn't run, consider executing the .jar file directly by typing the following command in the console:

```java -jar A1.jar```

If the .jar file won't execute, you can compile and run the source code directly:

1. Navigate to the "Source Code" folder.
2. Type the following in the console:  
    ```javac *.java```  
    ```java Main```
